# Academy-Awards
Guided project - used Pandas to clean a CSV dataset and export it to a SQLite database. 

For next steps, explore the rest of our original dataset academy_awards.csv and brainstorm how to fix the rest of the dataset:
The awards categories in older ceremonies were different than the ones we have today. What relevant information should we keep from older ceremonies?
What are all the different formatting styles that the Additional Info column contains. Can we use tools like regular expressions to capture these patterns and clean them up?
The nominations for the Art Direction category have lengthy values for Additional Info. What information is useful and how do we extract it?
Many values in Additional Info don't contain the character name the actor or actress played. Should we toss out character name altogether as we expand our data? What tradeoffs do we make by doing so?
What's the best way to handle awards ceremonies that included movies from 2 years?
E.g. see 1927/28 (1st) in the Year column.
